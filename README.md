**Note: No raw files are available on this repo, only compiled models and vmf templates for mapping. [Workshop link][ref-ws]**

**Note: This is not meant to be used with [Track Assembly][ref-ta]. I will not be adding support for it, and neither will the [creator of TA][ref-cta]. This is meant to be used in [Hammer][ref-hammer] by mappers.**   
  
### Branches
The [repo][ref-repo] is branched when updates are made that are not going to be published to the workshop. When a branch is closed, that version is pushed to the workshop.
