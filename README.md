### Description
This is not meant to be used with [Track Assembly][ref-ta].
I will not be adding support for it, and neither will the [creator of TA][ref-cta].
This is meant to be used in [Hammer][ref-hammer] by mappers. This is a track
pack made in [Hammer Propper][ref-hammer] for [Garry's Mod][ref-gmod] made by
[qwertyaaa (me)][ref-me] using the [Trackpack 3][ref-mag-tp3] design philosophy by
[Magnum MacKivler][ref-mag-user]. The name `GSTP` is an acronym for the full
title `G Scale Track Pack`. The `G` originally stood for Gmod, back when [Sligwolf][ref-sgw-user]
released his [Mini-trains][ref-sgw-mini] addon around `2013`. The track gauge
at that time was `13u`. This meant that the rails were off-grid when working in
Hammer, `0.5u` on either side of `12`.
  
**Note: No raw files are available on this repo, only compiled
models and vmf templates for mapping. [Workshop link][ref-ws]**
  
### Branches
The [repo][ref-repo] is branched when updates are made that are not going to be published to the workshop. When a branch is closed, that version is pushed to the workshop.
